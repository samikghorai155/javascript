            <p>n the small city of Rosario, Argentina, there was a little boy named Lionel Messi who loved nothing more than kicking a ball around. He was smaller than most kids, but his feet danced with the ball like magic.

When doctors told him he had a growth problem and needed expensive treatment, his family worried — they couldn’t afford it. But Messi never stopped dreaming.

One day, FC Barcelona heard about this tiny boy with a giant talent. They offered to help pay for his treatment if he came to Spain to play for their youth team. So at just 13 years old, Messi left home, carrying nothing but hope and a football dream.</p>
